✅ **Steps to Complete Task 5**

### 1. **Install and Launch Wireshark**

* Installed Wireshark on Kali Linux.
* Launched the tool and selected the active network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).

---

### 2. **Start Packet Capture**

* Clicked the blue **"Shark Fin"** icon to begin capturing packets.
* Ensured the system was connected to the internet for traffic generation.

---

### 3. **Generate Network Traffic**

* **Browsed websites** like `www.mozilla.org`, `www.google.com`, etc.
* **Used terminal commands** such as:

  ```bash
  ping www.google.com
  ```
* Traffic included DNS lookups, TCP handshakes, ICMP pings, and HTTP requests.

---

### 4. **Stop Capture After 1 Minute**

* Clicked the **red square button** in Wireshark to stop the capture.
* Saved the capture as `.pcap` file:

  * **Filename**: `network_capture.pcap`

---

### 5. **Filter Traffic by Protocol**

Used Wireshark filters to isolate different protocols:

* `dns` – for Domain Name queries.
* `tcp` – for TCP handshakes and HTTPS.
* `icmp` – for ping diagnostics.
* `http` – to view OCSP and other unencrypted web traffic.

---

### 6. **Analyze Packets**

* **DNS**: Identified domain resolution and authoritative responses.
* **TCP**: Observed three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
* **ICMP**: Noted both successful pings and port unreachable errors.
* **OCSP (via HTTP)**: Spotted certificate status checks for HTTPS validation.

---

### 7. **Take Screenshots**

* Captured evidence of different protocol traffic (as you've done):

  * DNS
  * TCP
  * ICMP
  * OCSP/HTTP
  * Ping command output
